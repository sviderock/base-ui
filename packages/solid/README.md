# _(WIP)_ This project is a work in progress.

- Library is compatible with **@base-ui-components/react@1.0.0-beta.1**
- Docs have everything copied over from the original React-based docs so **_a lot_** of discrepancies in text are present

### Please, consider supporting an awesome Base UI team directly on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/mui-org). This port is a gesture of appreciation of an increadible work they've been doing.
