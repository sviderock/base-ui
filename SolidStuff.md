- `ref` cannot be passed within nested params
- `ref` should always be passed as a `<Component ref={someRef} />` in components
- `ref` should always be passed as a `<Component ref={someVariable.someRef} />` when passed to `render` abstraction in tests
- all props for hooks have to be passed as context: plain object with reactive (accessor) properties
- hooks should return accessor instead of object with destructable accessors
- props.children will get resolved eagerly using `children()` helper so when rendered conditionally â€“ always repeat the same condition in the `children()` helper
- flushMicrotasks (act() wrapped) is not needed for Solidjs as it's synchronious
- need to `await waitFor` for various events like `fireEvent.focus()`
- a lot of type duplication (e.g. `DisabledIndecies` in `floating-ui-react`)
- need to use `@solid-primitives/autofocus` for the native autofocus to work
- there is a need to re-arrange effects and cleanup functions' order due to Solid having cleanups executing bottom-to-top while in React it's top-to-bottom which sometimes executes a wrong order of actions. This would probably require some changes in logic to make it more framework-agnostic.
- Solid has opposite to React order of unmount: in React it's top-to-bottom (first parent unmounts, then child) while in Solid it's bottom-to-top (child unmounts first, then parent) (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16728#issuecomment-584208473)
